### This was my first Hackathon event for 2 days and We named our group [Code of Duty](https://github.com/shivam-singh-au17/hackathon_App/). The goal of a hackathon is to create functioning software or hardware by the end of the event and this is my first hackathon. We created such functionality in this hackathon where people can see the value of courier delivery by different types of courier companies at one place and any user can send their courier at their convenience with the company in which they benefit. We have provided the facility to write by speaking here.

# Our Agendas - 
* First of all, we thought that what kind of functionality website we have to build?
* Breaking the whole work into the smallest divisions according to our strong zone.
* Setting up the deadline for every individual.
* Review the code when someone is unable to make the part prominently.
* Regular commits in GitHub and 2 times stand up so that everyone is updated accordingly.
* If some flaws are found in the original website, try to solve them as well.

# challenges to build this website
<h5>1. Communication
Distance always matters for group work. As we are from different parts of India, miscommunications were the common challenges for us. But, we make it happen with the help of slack and WhatsApp.</h5>
<h5>2. Collaboration
As we are using Git collaboration, initially we were facing some technical issues, but continuously co-ordinations, make things easier. <br> <br>
These two challenges improve our abilities to be a good Team Player.</h5>
