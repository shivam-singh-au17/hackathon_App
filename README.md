### The goal of a hackathon is to create functioning software or hardware by the end of the event and this is my first hackathon. We created such functionality in this hackathon where people can see the value of courier delivery by different types of courier companies at one place and any user can send their courier at their convenience with the company in which they benefit.

# challenges to build this website
<h5>1. Communication
Distance always matters for group work. As we are from different parts of India, miscommunications were the common challenges for us. But, we make it happen with the help of slack and WhatsApp.</h5>
<h5>2. Collaboration
As we are using Git collaboration, initially we were facing some technical issues, but continuously co-ordinations, make things easier. <br> <br>
These two challenges improve our abilities to be a good Team Player.</h5>

**These challenges improve our abilities to be a good Team Player and finally we did the constitution of all the problems together and made our perfect project.**
